  presentation: "About me"
  presentation-text: "I discovered coding in 2017, after years of studying foreign languages.
  It was love at fist sight!<br /><br />
  In 2019, I took a 9-week intensive training course in Bordeaux. That's when I decided to make a career as a web developer.
  I first started working for family and friends, to get some experience. Then, I opened my own business in July of 2020.
  <br /><br />
  Working on bigger projects with passionate people has been a real pleasure.<br />
  I hope you'll get in touch with me so that we can work on your project together. <br /><br />
  Talk to you soon.<br /><br />
  Fanny"
